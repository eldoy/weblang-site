## About

Weblang is created by Vidar Eldøy at [Eldøy Projects.](https://eldoy.com)

It is meant to simplify web development by making it:

- Easy to use and learn
- Minimize human errors
- Trivial to share and port
- Platform and language agnostic
- Safe and reasonably fast
- Can be extended to do anything anywhere

As we move towards automated programming using machine learning, using minimal building blocks is the way forward.

Weblang _is not_ a general purpose programming language and is very restricted. Most of its features must be added by you, _the programmer_, through extensions.

As an example of what you can do with Weblang, check out [_Flekk_](https://github.com/eldoy/flekk), our JSON API testing library. It makes writing tests for your API such an incredible breeze.

Please [send me a message](https://github.com/eldoy) if you have any feedback!

Enjoy!
