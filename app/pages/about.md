## About

Weblang is created by Vidar Eldøy at [Eldøy Projects.](https://eldoy.com)

**It is meant to simplify web development** by making it:

- **Easy to use and learn**
- **Minimize human errors**
- **Trivial to share and port**
- **Platform and language agnostic**
- **Safe and reasonably fast**
- **Extendable to do anything anywhere**

<br>
As we move towards automated programming using machine learning, using minimal building blocks is the way forward.
<br>
<br>

**Weblang _is not_ a general purpose programming language,** but is domain specific. Most of its features must be added by you, _the programmer_, through extensions.

As an example of what you can do with Weblang, check out [_Flekk_](https://github.com/eldoy/flekk), our JSON API testing library. It makes writing tests for your API such an incredible breeze.

Enjoy!
